JSZip is third party library for LZ compression. 

It is independent on TreeGrid. It is distributed under MIT or GPLv3 license.
It can be downloaded or its licensing read at https://stuk.github.io/jszip/

It is loaded by TreeGrid only when importing or exporting XLSX.
It is required for XLSX import, but it is optional for XLSX export.
To not use it for XLSX export, set <Cfg JSZip='0'/>, in this case the export will produce longer uncompressed XLSX files.

js.zip.min.js is the latest version with asynchronous usage
js.zip.min.sync.js is version 2.6. with synchronous usage, if grid has set Sync='1', required for printing to pdf
